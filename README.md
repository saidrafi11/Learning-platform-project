Hi this is Saidur Rahman. I developed this project as a resale market place site where I tried to implement some basic feature of a marketplace website. The features are :

1. In the home page you will see a navbar, Slider, a advertisement section along with a category section and a footer also.

2. Category route is a privete route where you're required logged in. And after logging in you will see products carts. If you click "book now" button a modal wll pop up and you can make order by providing relevent information. You will see your orderd products from dashboard.

4. In the product cards you will notice a BLUE TICK mark which represent the verified seller.

5. If you are a seller you have to create a seller account. In the sign in page you have an option to do this.

6. Seller can add products, advertise unsold procucts.  If a product is booked you won't advertise the product. In a sum, you will see the advertise button only if the product is available.

7. In the admin Dashboard, you will see All users, all sellers route. You can verify a seller by clicking "Verify" button. You are allowed to delete a seller and also a user account if you are an admin.
